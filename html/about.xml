<h1>About</h1>
<p>
After a long hiatus caused mainly by overwhelming work on other projects,
some work on meteo has resumed.
<ul>
<li>
The source code has been modernized to no longer generate any warnings
or have problems with missing header files.
Some functions that have been deprecated were eliminated.
</li>
<li>
A new outlet class was added that allows weather data to be sent as a UDP
packet to the telescope automation system RTS2.
A request to make this feature available was the main driver of the
renewed effort.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This free software package is used to retrieve meteorological data
from a Davis Weather Monitor II, Perception, Weather Wizard
or a Davis Vantage Pro Station.
Experimental support for Davis GroWeather, Health and
Energy Stations is also included (untested since I don't have the Hardware).
It normalizes the data and stores a data point every minute in a MySQL
database.
Later on, graphs can be drawn and inserted into web pages that
display the development of the most important parameters.
Here are the stations used to develop this package:

<p>
There also is a <a href="meteodata.html" target="_new">page describing the
graphs</a>.
Most of that information is now also included in the browser pages.
</p>
<p>
There are essentially two visual interfaces to the database:
<ol>
<li>
The <b>meteodraw</b>(1) program (<b>meteograph</b>(1) in previous releases)
can be used to generate graphs for every
point in time, and to store them in some directory accessible via 
a web server. A script like <b>meteojob</b> can be used to do this
from cron. The <b>meteooverview</b>(1) script can generate some pages
referencing the graphs. This is essentially a static interface and is
usually used to display current weather condition graphs generated by the

<b>meteojob</b> script.
</li>
<li>
Starting with version 0.2, there is a PHP-based meteo browser that allows
to browse through the complete database at every level of detail available.
A sample installation is available at
<a href="http://meteo.othello.ch/meteo/meteobrowser.php" target="_new">http://meteo.othello.ch/meteo/meteobrowser.php</a>.
See the <a href="http://meteo.othello.ch/README.browser">README.browser</a> for information about
installing the script.
</li>
</ol>
