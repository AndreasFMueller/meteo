Wishes

* add timezone flag to meteodraw program, since some platforms ignore the
  timezone environment variable, notably Mac OS X

* add an operator that allows to determine maximum and/or minium, the
  interval should be configurable and it should be possible to graphical
  represent the interval

* add an option to equip the graph with a documentation of the time interval
  for which it was drawn.

* add legend attribute to channel tag, which includes a legend in the graph

* test the new minimum range code in GraphWindow.cc

* update NEWS file

Bugs

* computed sun channel apparently does not take time zone into account

* check 60 seconds graphs, there seem to be some problems with computed
  channels

* on a make clean, remove the .mo files in browser/po

* timelabel normalization has a bug which causes it to normalize to the
  previous week in 2005
